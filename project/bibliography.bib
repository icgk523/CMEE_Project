  abstract  = "Summary While phylogenies have been getting easier to build, it
               has been difficult to reuse, combine and synthesize the
               information they provide because published trees are often only
               available as image files, and taxonomic information is not
               standardized across studies. The Open Tree of Life (OTL) project
               addresses these issues by providing a digital tree that
               encompasses all organisms, built by combining taxonomic
               information and published phylogenies. The project also provides
               tools and services to query and download parts of this synthetic
               tree, as well as the source data used to build it. Here, we
               present rotl, an R package to search and download data from the
               Open Tree of Life directly in R. rotl uses common data
               structures allowing researchers to take advantage of the rich
               set of tools and methods that are available in R to manipulate,
               analyse and visualize phylogenies. Here, and in the vignettes

               with other R packages to analyse biodiversity data. As
               phylogenies are being used in a growing number of applications,

TOGA implements a different paradigm to infer orthologous loci, improves ortholog detection and annotation of conserved genes compared with state-of-the-art methods, and handles even highly fragmented assemblies. TOGA scales to hundreds of genomes, which we demonstrate by applying it to 488 placental mammal and 501 bird assemblies, creating the largest comparative gene resources so far. Additionally, TOGA detects gene losses, enables selection screens, and automatically provides a superior measure of mammalian genome quality. TOGA is a powerful and scalable method to annotate and compare genes in the genomic era.}}

The evolutionary transitions from prokaryotes to unicellular eukaryotes to metazoans were accompanied by major innovations in metabolic design. Here we show that the scalings of metabolic rate, population growth rate, and production efficiency with body size have changed across the evolutionary transitions. Metabolic rate scales with body mass superlinearly in prokaryotes, linearly in protists, and sublinearly in metazoans, so Kleiber’s 3/4 power scaling law does not apply universally across organisms. The scaling of maximum population growth rate shifts from positive in prokaryotes to negative in protists and metazoans, and the efficiency of production declines across these groups. Major changes in metabolic processes during the early evolution of life overcame existing constraints, exploited new opportunities, and imposed new constraints.}}

Leveraging the existing datasets of 233 neoavian bird species, here, we investigated whether generation time and body mass contribute to the interspecific variation of orthologous microsatellite length, transposable element (TE) length, and deletion length and how these genomic attributes affect genome sizes. In nonpasserines, we found that generation time is correlated to both orthologous microsatellite length and TE length, and body mass is negatively correlated to DNA deletions. These patterns are less pronounced in passerines. In all species, we found that DNA deletions relate to genome size similarly as TE length, suggesting a role of body mass dynamics in genome evolution. Our results indicate that generation time and body mass shape the evolution of genomic attributes in neoavian birds. Generation time and body mass in neoavian birds explain variations in key genomic attributes.}}

C-value directly affects cell size and specific metabolic rate indirectly. Body size can enlarge through increase of cell size and/or cell number, with small cells having higher metabolic rates. We argue that scaling exponents of interspecific allometries of metabolic rates are by-products of evolutionary diversification of C-values within narrow taxonomic groups, which underlines the participation of cell size and cell number in body size optimization. This optimization leads to an inverse relation between slopes of interspecific allometries of metabolic rates and C-value. To test this prediction we extracted literature data on basal metabolic rate (BMR), body mass, and C-value of mammals and birds representing six and eight orders, respectively. Analysis of covariance revealed significant heterogeneity of the allometric slopes of BMR and C-value in both mammals and birds. As we predicted, the correlation between allometric exponents of BMR and C-value was negative and statistically significant among mammalian and avian orders.}}

ABSTRACT = {The body size and (or) complexity of organisms is not uniformly related to the amount of genetic material (DNA) contained in each of their cell nuclei (‘genome size’). This surprising mismatch between the physical structure of organisms and their underlying genetic information appears to relate to variable accumulation of repetitive DNA sequences, but why this variation has evolved is little understood. Here, I show that genome size correlates more positively with egg size than adult size in crustaceans. I explain this and comparable patterns observed in other kinds of animals and plants as resulting from genome size relating strongly to cell size in most organisms, which should also apply to single-celled eggs and other reproductive propagules with relatively few cells that are pivotal first steps in their lives. However, since body size results from growth in cell size or number or both, it relates to genome size in diverse ways. Relationships between genome size and body size should be especially weak in large organisms whose size relates more to cell multiplication than to cell enlargement, as is generally observed. The ubiquitous single-cell ‘bottleneck’ of life cycles may affect both genome size and composition, and via both informational (genotypic) and non-informational (nucleotypic) effects, many other properties of multicellular organisms (e.g., rates of growth and metabolism) that have both theoretical and practical significance.},

               is associated with local LINE element density. In contrast, the

Currently, 1219 insect genome-sequencing projects have been registered with the National Center for Biotechnology Information, including 401 that have genome assemblies and 155 with an official gene set of annotated protein-coding genes. Comparative genomics analysis showed that the expansion or contraction of gene families was associated with well-studied physiological traits such as immune system, metabolic detoxification, parasitism and polyphagy in insects. Here, we summarize the progress of insect genome sequencing, with an emphasis on how this impacts research on pest control. We begin with a brief introduction to the basic concepts of genome assembly, annotation and metrics for evaluating the quality of draft assemblies. We then provide an overview of genome information for numerous insect species, highlighting examples from prominent model organisms, agricultural pests and disease vectors. We also introduce the major insect genome databases. The increasing availability of insect genomic resources is beneficial for developing alternative pest control methods. However, many opportunities remain for developing data-mining tools that make maximal use of the available insect genome resources. Although rapid progress has been achieved, many challenges remain in the field of insect genomics.},

abstract = {Abstract Changes in telomere length are increasingly used to indicate species' response to environmental stress across diverse taxa. Despite this broad use, few studies have explored telomere length in plants. Thus, evaluation of new approaches for measuring telomeres in plants is needed. Rapid advances in sequencing approaches and bioinformatic tools now allow estimation of telomere content from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, a proxy for telomere length. While telomere content has been quantified extensively using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and WGS in humans, no study to date has compared the effectiveness of WGS in estimating telomere length in plants relative to qPCR approaches. In this study, we use 100 Populus clones re-sequenced using short-read Illumina sequencing to quantify telomere length comparing three different bioinformatic approaches (Computel, K-seek and TRIP) in addition to qPCR. Overall, telomere length estimates varied across different bioinformatic approaches, but were highly correlated across methods for individual genotypes. A positive correlation was observed between WGS estimates and qPCR, however, Computel estimates exhibited the greatest correlation. Computel incorporates genome coverage into telomere length calculations, suggesting that genome coverage is likely important to telomere length quantification when using WGS data. Overall, telomere estimates from WGS provided greater precision and accuracy of telomere length estimates relative to qPCR. The findings suggest WGS is a promising approach for assessing telomere length and, as the field of telomere ecology evolves, may provide added value to assaying response to biotic and abiotic environments for plants needed to accelerate plant breeding and conservation management.},

This review provides a critical and synthetic overview of body size variation in insects from a predominantly macroecological (large-scale temporal and spatial) perspective. Because of the importance of understanding the proximate determinants of adult size, it commences with a brief summary of the physiological mechanisms underlying adult body size and its variation, based mostly on findings for the model species Drosophila melanogaster and Manduca sexta. Variation in nutrition and temperature have variable effects on critical weight, the interval to cessation of growth (or terminal growth period) and growth rates, so influencing final adult size. Ontogenetic and phylogenetic variation in size, compensatory growth, scaling at the intra- and interspecific levels, sexual size dimorphism, and body size optimisation are then reviewed in light of their influences on individual and species body size frequency distributions. Explicit attention is given to evolutionary trends, including gigantism, Cope's rule and the rates at which size change has taken place, and to temporal ecological trends such as variation in size with succession and size-selectivity during the invasion process. Large-scale spatial variation in size at the intraspecific, interspecific and assemblage levels is considered, with special attention being given to the mechanisms proposed to underlie clinal variation in adult body size. Finally, areas particularly in need of additional research are identified.},

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Skewed body size distributions and the high relative
               richness of small-bodied taxa are a fundamental property of a
               wide range of animal clades. The evolutionary processes
               responsible for generating these distributions are well
               described in vertebrate model systems but have yet to be
               explored in detail for other major terrestrial clades. In this
               study, we explore the macro-evolutionary patterns of body size
               variation across families of Hexapoda (insects and their close
               relatives), using recent advances in phylogenetic understanding,
               with an aim to investigate the link between size and diversity
               within this ancient and highly diverse lineage. RESULTS: The
               maximum, minimum and mean-log body lengths of hexapod families
               are all approximately log-normally distributed, consistent with
               previous studies at lower taxonomic levels, and contrasting with
               skewed distributions typical of vertebrate groups. After taking
               phylogeny and within-tip variation into account, we find no
               evidence for a negative relationship between diversification
               rate and body size, suggesting decoupling of the forces
               controlling these two traits. Likelihood-based modeling of the
               log-mean body size identifies distinct processes operating
               within Holometabola and Diptera compared with other hexapod
               groups, consistent with accelerating rates of size evolution
               within these clades, while as a whole, hexapod body size
               evolution is found to be dominated by neutral processes
               including significant phylogenetic conservatism. CONCLUSIONS:
               Based on our findings we suggest that the use of models derived
               from well-studied but atypical clades, such as vertebrates may
               lead to misleading conclusions when applied to other major
               terrestrial lineages. Our results indicate that within hexapods,
               and within the limits of current systematic and phylogenetic
               knowledge, insect diversification is generally unfettered by
               size-biased macro-evolutionary processes, and that these
               processes over large timescales tend to converge on apparently
               neutral evolutionary processes. We also identify limitations on
               available data within the clade and modeling approaches for the
               resolution of trees of higher taxa, the resolution of which may
               collectively enhance our understanding of this key component of
               terrestrial ecosystems.",

  abstract  = "The area and thickness of respiratory surfaces, and the
               constraints they impose on passive oxygen diffusion, have been
               linked to differences in oxygen consumption rates and/or aerobic
               activity levels in vertebrates. However, it remains unclear how
               respiratory surfaces and associated diffusion rates vary with
               body mass across vertebrates, particularly in relation to the
               body mass scaling of oxygen consumption rates. Here we address
               these issues by first quantifying the body mass dependence of
               respiratory surface area and respiratory barrier thickness for a
               diversity of endotherms (birds and mammals) and ectotherms
               (fishes, amphibians, and reptiles). Based on these findings, we
               then use Fick's law to predict the body mass scaling of oxygen
               diffusion for each group. Finally, we compare the predicted body
               mass dependence of oxygen diffusion to that of oxygen
               consumption in endotherms and ectotherms. We find that the
               slopes and intercepts of the relationships describing the body
               mass dependence of passive oxygen diffusion in these two groups
               are statistically indistinguishable from those describing the
               body mass dependence of oxygen consumption. Thus, the area and
               thickness of respiratory surfaces combine to match oxygen
               diffusion capacity to oxygen consumption rates in both air- and
               water-breathing vertebrates. In particular, the substantially
               lower oxygen consumption rates of ectotherms of a given body
               mass relative to those of endotherms correspond to differences
               in oxygen diffusion capacity. These results provide insights

Energy requirements alone can explain how population density decreases, but not the steep rate at which home range area increases. We present a general mechanistic model that predicts the frequency of interaction, spatial overlap, and loss of resources to neighbors. Extensive empirical evidence supports the model, demonstrating that spatial constraints on defense cause exclusivity of home range use to decrease with increasing body size. In large mammals, over 90\% of available resources may be lost to neighbors. Our model offers a general framework to understand animal space use and sociality.}}

Genome size (GS) can vary considerably between phylogenetically close species, but the landscape of GS changes in insects remain largely unclear. To better understand the specific evolutionary factors that determine GS in insects, we examined flow cytometry-based published GS data from 1,326 insect species, spanning 700 genera, 155 families, and 21 orders. Model fitting showed that GS generally followed an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck adaptive evolutionary model in Insecta overall. Ancestral reconstruction indicated a likely GS of 1,069 Mb, suggesting that most insect clades appeared to undergo massive genome expansions or contractions. Quantification of genomic components in 56 species from nine families in four insect orders revealed that the proliferation of transposable elements contributed to high variation in GS between close species, such as within Coleoptera. This study sheds lights on the pattern of GS variation in insects and provides a better understanding of insect GS evolution.}

               of thousands of species' genomes are becoming available. Within
               the sequences are repeats that comprise significant portions of
               genomes. Successful annotations thus require accurate discovery
               of repeats. As species-specific elements, repeats in newly
               sequenced genomes are likely to be unknown. Therefore,
               annotating newly sequenced genomes requires tools to discover
               repeats de-novo. However, the currently available de-novo tools
               have limitations concerning the size of the input sequence, ease
               of use, sensitivities to major types of repeats, consistency of
               performance, speed, and false positive rate. RESULTS: To address
               these limitations, I designed and developed Red, applying
               Machine Learning. Red is the first repeat-detection tool capable
               of labeling its training data and training itself automatically
               on an entire genome. Red is easy to install and use. It is
               sensitive to both transposons and simple repeats; in contrast,
               available tools such as RepeatScout and ReCon are sensitive to
               transposons, and WindowMasker to simple repeats. Red performed
               consistently well on seven genomes; the other tools performed
               well only on some genomes. Red is much faster than RepeatScout
               and ReCon and has a much lower false positive rate than
               WindowMasker. On human genes with five or more copies, Red was
               more specific than RepeatScout by a wide margin. When tested on
               genomes of unusual nucleotide compositions, Red located repeats
               with high sensitivities and maintained moderate false positive
               rates. Red outperformed the related tools on a bacterial genome.
               Red identified 46,405 novel repetitive segments in the human
               genome. Finally, Red is capable of processing assembled and
               unassembled genomes. CONCLUSIONS: Red's innovative methodology
               and its excellent performance on seven different genomes

               best-studied of the ``major evolutionary transitions''. It has
               occurred independently multiple times within the eukaryotes
               alone, and multicellular organisms comprise virtually the
               entirety of Earth's macrobiota. However, the theoretical
               framework used to study the major evolutionary transitions does
               not neatly accommodate the evolution of complex multicellularity
               as a process distinct from the evolution of multicellularity
               more generally. Here, I attempt to fill this explanatory gap. I
               will first give an overview of research on the major
               evolutionary transitions, focusing on multicellularity, and
               demonstrate that the theoretical framework so far utilised does
               not provide us with sufficient conceptual tools to explain
               crucial phenomena that call for explanation, such as the

               multicellularity that is potentially applicable to other such
               cases such as the evolution of land plants. This paves the way
               for a revised account of major evolutionary transitions which

  abstract  = "Genome size has long been hypothesized to affect the metabolic
               rate in various groups of animals. The mechanism behind this
               proposed association is the nucleotypic effect, in which large
               nucleus and cell sizes influence cellular metabolism through
               surface area-to-volume ratios. Here, we provide a review of the
               recent literature on the relationship between genome size and
               metabolic rate. We also conduct an analysis using phylogenetic
               comparative methods and a large sample of extant vertebrates. We
               find no evidence that the effect of genome size improves upon
               models in explaining metabolic rate variation. Not surprisingly,
               our results show a strong positive relationship between
               metabolic rate and body mass, as well as a substantial
               difference in metabolic rate between endothermic and ectothermic
               vertebrates, controlling for body mass. The presence of
               endothermy can also explain elevated rate shifts in metabolic
               rate whereas genome size cannot. We further find no evidence for
               a punctuated model of evolution for metabolic rate. Our results
               do not rule out the possibility that genome size affects
               cellular physiology in some tissues, but they are consistent
               with previous research suggesting little support for a direct

    abstract = {Animal genomes vary widely in size, and much of their architecture and content remains poorly understood. Even among related groups, such as orders of insects, genomes may vary in size by orders of magnitude–for reasons unknown. The largest known insect genomes were repeatedly found in Orthoptera, e.g., Podisma pedestris (1C = 16.93 pg), Stethophyma grossum (1C = 18.48 pg) and Bryodemella holdereri (1C = 18.64 pg). While all these species belong to the suborder of Caelifera, the ensiferan Deracantha onos (1C = 19.60 pg) was recently found to have the largest genome. Here, we present new genome size estimates of 50 further species of Ensifera (superfamilies Gryllidea, Tettigoniidea) and Caelifera (Acrididae, Tetrigidae) based on flow cytometric measurements. We found that Bryodemella tuberculata (Caelifera: Acrididae) has the so far largest measured genome of all insects with 1C = 21.96 pg (21.48 gBp). Species of Orthoptera with 2n = 16 and 2n = 22 chromosomes have significantly larger genomes than species with other chromosome counts. Gryllidea genomes vary between 1C = 0.95 and 2.88 pg, and Tetrigidae between 1C = 2.18 and 2.41, while the genomes of all other studied Orthoptera range in size from 1C = 1.37 to 21.96 pg. Reconstructing ancestral genome sizes based on a phylogenetic tree of mitochondrial genomic data, we found genome size values of >15.84 pg only for the nodes of Bryodemella holdereri / B. tuberculata and Chrysochraon dispar / Euthystira brachyptera. The predicted values of ancestral genome sizes are 6.19 pg for Orthoptera, 5.37 pg for Ensifera, and 7.28 pg for Caelifera. The reasons for the large genomes in Orthoptera remain largely unknown, but a duplication or polyploidization seems unlikely as chromosome numbers do not differ much. Sequence-based genomic studies may shed light on the underlying evolutionary mechanisms.},

  title     = "Energetics and genetics across the prokaryote-eukaryote divide",
  author    = "Lane, Nick",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: All complex life on Earth is eukaryotic. All
               eukaryotic cells share a common ancestor that arose just once in
               four billion years of evolution. Prokaryotes show no tendency to
               evolve greater morphological complexity, despite their metabolic
               virtuosity. Here I argue that the eukaryotic cell originated in
               a unique prokaryotic endosymbiosis, a singular event that
               transformed the selection pressures acting on both host and
               endosymbiont. RESULTS: The reductive evolution and
               specialisation of endosymbionts to mitochondria resulted in an
               extreme genomic asymmetry, in which the residual mitochondrial
               genomes enabled the expansion of bioenergetic membranes over
               several orders of magnitude, overcoming the energetic
               constraints on prokaryotic genome size, and permitting the host
               cell genome to expand (in principle) over 200,000-fold. This
               energetic transformation was permissive, not prescriptive; I
               suggest that the actual increase in early eukaryotic genome size
               was driven by a heavy early bombardment of genes and introns
               from the endosymbiont to the host cell, producing a high
               mutation rate. Unlike prokaryotes, with lower mutation rates and
               heavy selection pressure to lose genes, early eukaryotes without
               genome-size limitations could mask mutations by cell fusion and
               genome duplication, as in allopolyploidy, giving rise to a
               proto-sexual cell cycle. The side effect was that a large number
               of shared eukaryotic basal traits accumulated in the same
               population, a sexual eukaryotic common ancestor, radically
               different to any known prokaryote. CONCLUSIONS: The combination
               of massive bioenergetic expansion, release from genome-size
               constraints, and high mutation rate favoured a protosexual cell
               cycle and the accumulation of eukaryotic traits. These factors
               explain the unique origin of eukaryotes, the absence of true
               evolutionary intermediates, and the evolution of sex in
               eukaryotes but not prokaryotes. REVIEWERS: This article was

    abstract = {In recent years it became clear that in eukaryotic genome evolution gene loss is prevalent over gene gain. However, the absence of genes in an annotated genome is not always equivalent to the loss of genes. Due to sequencing issues, or incorrect gene prediction, genes can be falsely inferred as absent. This implies that loss estimates are overestimated and, more generally, that falsely inferred absences impact genomic comparative studies. However, reliable estimates of how prevalent this issue is are lacking. Here we quantified the impact of gene prediction on gene loss estimates in eukaryotes by analysing 209 phylogenetically diverse eukaryotic organisms and comparing their predicted proteomes to that of their respective six-frame translated genomes. We observe that 4.61% of domains per species were falsely inferred to be absent for Pfam domains predicted to have been present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Between phylogenetically different categories this estimate varies substantially: for clade-specific loss (ancestral loss) we found 1.30% and for species-specific loss 16.88% to be falsely inferred as absent. For BUSCO 1-to-1 orthologous families, 18.30% were falsely inferred to be absent. Finally, we showed that falsely inferred absences indeed impact loss estimates, with the number of losses decreasing by 11.78%. Our work strengthens the increasing number of studies showing that gene loss is an important factor in eukaryotic genome evolution. However, while we demonstrate that on average inferring gene absences from predicted proteomes is reliable, caution is warranted when inferring species-specific absences.},

               synthesised quantitatively, nor compared with temperature--size
               (T--S) responses measured under controlled laboratory
               conditions. Here we quantitatively examine variation in
               intraspecific A--S clines among 121 insect species from 50
               different global locations, representing 12 taxonomic orders.
               While some taxa were better represented in the literature than
               others, our analysis reveals extensive variation in the
               magnitude and direction of A--S clines. Following the assumption
               that temperature on average declines by 1°C per 150 m increase
               in altitude, order‐specific A--S clines in the field appear to
               deviate from laboratory T--S responses. Specifically, the
               magnitude of A--S clines and T--S responses are more closely
               matched in some taxonomic orders (e.g. Diptera) than others
               (e.g. Orthoptera). These findings contrast with the strong
               co‐variation observed between latitude‐size clines and T--S
               responses, and between laboratory and seasonal T--S responses.
               The lack of clear size relationships with elevation, and hence
               temperature, is likely due to the counteracting effects of other
               major drivers with altitude, including season length and oxygen
               partial pressure. Switches in voltinism within species across
               altitude, and the dispersal of individuals across different
               elevations, may also obscure trends. A plain language summary is

               impractical to measure directly. Allometric scaling laws have
               been used to overcome this problem. However, most existing
               models rely upon small sample sizes, geographically restricted
               sampling and have limited applicability for non-bee taxa.
               Allometric models that consider biogeography, phylogenetic
               relatedness, and intraspecific variation are urgently required
               to ensure greater accuracy. We measured body size as dry weight
               and intertegular distance (ITD) of 391 bee species (4,035
               specimens) and 103 hoverfly species (399 specimens) across four
               biogeographic regions: Australia, Europe, North America, and
               South America. We updated existing models within a Bayesian

               with different co-variates: phylogeny or taxonomy, sexual

               ordinary least squares regression to assess intraspecific dry

               species. Including co-variates led to more robust interspecific
               body size predictions for both bees and hoverflies relative to
               models with the ITD alone. In contrast, at the intraspecific
               level, our results demonstrate that the ITD is an inconsistent

               allometric scaling laws to estimate body size is more suitable
               for interspecific comparative analyses than assessing

  abstract  = "Global warming appears to favour smaller-bodied organisms, but
               whether larger species are also more vulnerable to thermal
               extremes, as suggested for past mass-extinction events, is still
               an open question. Here, we tested whether interspecific
               differences in thermal tolerance (heat and cold) of ectotherm
               organisms are linked to differences in their body mass and
               genome size (as a proxy for cell size). Since the vulnerability
               of larger, aquatic taxa to warming has been attributed to the
               oxygen limitation hypothesis, we also assessed how body mass and
               genome size modulate thermal tolerance in species with
               contrasting breathing modes, habitats and life stages. A
               database with the upper (CTmax) and lower (CTmin) critical
               thermal limits and their methodological aspects was assembled
               comprising more than 500 species of ectotherms. Our results
               demonstrate that thermal tolerance in ectotherms is dependent on
               body mass and genome size and these relationships became
               especially evident in prolonged experimental trials where energy
               efficiency gains importance. During long-term trials, CTmax was
               impaired in larger-bodied water-breathers, consistent with a
               role for oxygen limitation. Variation in CTmin was mostly
               explained by the combined effects of body mass and genome size
               and it was enhanced in larger-celled, air-breathing species
               during long-term trials, consistent with a role for
               depolarization of cell membranes. Our results also highlight the
               importance of accounting for phylogeny and exposure duration.
               Especially when considering long-term trials, the observed
               effects on thermal limits are more in line with the
               warming-induced reduction in body mass observed during long-term

               than others is critical for conservation efforts. Functional
               trait-based approaches offer a promising tool to achieve this
               goal. In forests, deadwood-dependent (saproxylic) beetles
               comprise a major part of threatened species, but analyses of
               their extinction risk have been hindered by the availability of
               suitable morphological traits. To better understand the
               mechanisms underlying extinction in insects, we investigated the
               relationships between morphological features and the extinction
               risk of saproxylic beetles. Specifically, we hypothesised that
               species darker in colour, with a larger and rounder body, a
               lower mobility, lower sensory perception, and more robust
               mandibles are at higher risk. We first developed a protocol for
               morphological trait measurements and present a database of 37
               traits for 1157 European saproxylic beetle species. Based on 13
               selected, independent traits characterising aspects of colour,
               body shape, locomotion, sensory perception and foraging, we used
               a proportional-odds multiple linear mixed-effects model to model
               the German Red List categories of 744 species as an ordinal
               index of extinction risk. Six out of 13 traits correlated
               significantly with extinction risk. Larger species, as well as
               species with a broad and round body, had a higher extinction
               risk than small, slim and flattened species. Species with short
               wings had a higher extinction risk than those with long wings.
               On the contrary, extinction risk increased with decreasing wing
               load and with higher mandibular aspect ratio (shorter and more
               robust mandibles). Our study provides new insights into how
               morphological traits, beyond the widely used body size,
               determine the extinction risk of saproxylic beetles. Moreover,
               our approach shows that the morphological characteristics of
               beetles can be comprehensively represented by a selection of 13
               traits. We recommend them as a starting point for functional
               analyses in the rapidly growing field of ecological and

               Seasonality is estimated here by flight activity period length
               and phenology by peak activity. We develop several methods to
               estimate these traits from low-resolution sampling data. The
               relationship between abundance and body size was significant and
               as expected; the smaller species were more abundant. However,
               smaller species tended to fly for longer periods of the summer
               and peaked in midsummer, while larger species were restricted to
               shorter temporal windows. Further analysis of repeated sampling
               from a single location suggested that smaller species had
               increased flight period lengths in warmer years, but larger
               species showed the opposite pattern. The results 1) indicate
               that smaller species are likely to be disproportionately
               valuable in ecological interactions, and 2) provide potential
               insights into the traits influencing the vulnerability of some
               larger species to disturbances and climate change.",

               Metabolic rate is predicted to vary with absolute body

               by temperature and is predicted to scale with body mass to the
               quarter power based on 1) the ontogenetic growth model of the
               metabolic theory of ecology which describes a bioenergetic
               balance between tissue maintenance and growth given the scaling
               relationship between metabolism and body size, and 2) numerous
               studies, primarily of vertebrate endotherms, that largely
               support this prediction. However, few studies have investigated
               the allometry of development time among invertebrates, including
               insects. Abundant data on development of diverse insects
               provides an ideal opportunity to better understand the scaling
               of development time in this ecologically and economically
               important group. Insects develop more quickly at warmer
               temperatures until reaching a minimum development time at some
               optimal temperature, after which development slows. We evaluated
               the allometry of insect development time by compiling estimates
               of minimum development time and optimal developmental
               temperature for 361 insect species from 16 orders with body mass
               varying over nearly 6 orders of magnitude. Allometric scaling
               exponents varied with the statistical approach: standardized
               major axis regression supported the predicted quarter-power
               scaling relationship, but ordinary and phylogenetic generalized
               least squares did not. Regardless of the statistical approach,
               body size alone explained less than 28\% of the variation in
               development time. Models that also included optimal temperature
               explained over 50\% of the variation in development time.
               Warm-adapted insects developed more quickly, regardless of body
               size, supporting the ``hotter is better'' hypothesis that posits
               that ectotherms have a limited ability to evolutionarily
               compensate for the depressing effects of low temperatures on
               rates of biological processes. The remaining unexplained

               has been found to scale allometrically with body mass. The
               variation that could not be explained by body mass has been
               explained with several variables such as habitat productivity,
               trophic level, locomotion strategy and thermoregulation. All

               Here, we studied the relationship of a species's territory size
               with its fresh body mass (FBM) in addition to other ecologically
               relevant traits using 86 damselfly and dragonfly (Odonata)

               mostly perch. Breeding habitat or the presence of sexual
               characters did not affect territory sizes, but lotic species and
               species without wing spots had steeper allometric slopes. It
               seems that an increase in a species's body mass increases its

               butterflies) frequently rely on single linear estimates of body
               size, namely of forewing length or wingspan. As the shape of the
               wings of these insects - in fact, of all body parts - differs
               from one taxon to another, such estimates of body mass may not
               be adequate for comparisons across a wide taxonomic range. Using
               the length and width of the forewing, thorax and abdomen, as
               well as the wing area of 375 species and their correlations with
               dry body weight, several composite indices were determined that
               might be used in different circumstances. As the coefficients of
               determination from the multivariate regression models were
               rather high (R 2 >0.96), the results are believed to be

abstract = {Abstract The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an empirical question, but general tools for detecting and quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We present new methods for continuous-valued characters that can be implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or generalized least-squares models. First, a simple randomization procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I error rate at a nominal α= 0.05 and good power (0.8) for simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the amount of phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third, we provide two biologically motivated branch-length transformations, one based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of stabilizing selection, the other based on a new model in which character evolution can accelerate or decelerate (ACDC) in rate (e.g., as may occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum likelihood estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g) parameters can serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data will increase power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable for further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character evolution. Application of the methods to data from the literature revealed that, for trees with 20 or more species, 92\% of traits exhibited significant phylogenetic signal (randomization test), including behavioral and ecological ones that are thought to be relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive) and/or subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic) effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average) showed less signal than expected given the topology, branch lengths, and a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was less than one), which may be attributed to adaptation and/or measurement error in the broad sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes, branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance of log K for all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral traits exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life-history, or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits (corrected for body size) showed less signal than did body size itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the estimated OU (25\% of traits) and/or ACDC (40\%) transformation parameter differed significantly from both zero and unity, indicating that a hierarchical tree with less (or occasionally more) structure than the original better fit the data and so could be preferred for comparative analyses.},

A generalized linear model (GLM) is presented for the analysis of comparative data, which can be used to address questions regarding the relationship between traits or between traits and environments, the rate of phenotypic evolution, the degree of phylogenetic effect, and the ancestral state of a character. Our approach thus emphasizes the similarity among evolutionary questions asked in comparative studies. We then discuss ways of specifying the sources of error involved in a comparative study (e.g., measurement error, error due to evolution along a phylogeny, error due to misspecification of a phylogeny) and show how the impact of these sources of error can be taken into account in a comparative analysis. In contrast to most existing phylogenetic comparative methods, our procedure offers substantial flexibility in the choice of microevolutionary assumptions underlying the statistical analysis, allowing researchers to choose assumptions that are most appropriate for their particular set of data and evolutionary question. In developing the approach, we also propose novel ways of incorporating within-species variation and/or measurement error into phylogenetic analyses, of estimating ancestral states, and of considering both continuous (quantitative) and categorical (qualitative or "state") characters in the same analysis. }

Information about the phylogeny of the species is assumed to be available in the form of a working phylogeny, which contains multiple nodes representing ignorance about the order of splitting of taxa. The non-independence between species is divided into that due to recognized phylogeny, that is, to phylogenetic associations represented in the working phylogeny; and that due to unrecognized phylogeny. The new method uses one linear contrast for each higher node in the working phylogeny, thus applying the ‘radiation principle’. For binary phylogenies the method is similar to an existing method. A criterion is suggested in the form of a simulation test for deciding on the acceptability of proposed statistical methods for analysing cross-species data with a continuous y-variable. This criterion is applied to the phylogenetic regression and to some other methods. The phylogenetic regression passes this test; the other methods tested fail it. Arbitrary choices have to be made about the covariance structure of the error in order to implement the method. It is argued that error results from omitted but relevant variables, and the implications for those arbitrary choices are discussed. One conclusion is that the dates of splits between taxa, even supplemented by rates of neutral gene evolution, do not provide the ‘ true ’ covariance structure. A pragmatic approach is adopted. Several analytical results about the phylogenetic regression are given, without proof, in a mathematical appendix. A computer program has been written in GLIM to implement the phylogenetic regression, and readers are informed how to obtain a copy. }

In this work, we conduct a genome-wide screen for adaptive TE insertions in Drosophila melanogaster that have taken place during or after the spread of this species out of Africa. We determine population frequencies of 902 of the 1,572 TEs in Release 3 of the D. melanogaster genome and identify a set of 13 putatively adaptive TEs. These 13 TEs increased in population frequency sharply after the spread out of Africa. We argue that many of these TEs are in fact adaptive by demonstrating that the regions flanking five of these TEs display signatures of partial selective sweeps. Furthermore, we show that eight out of the 13 putatively adaptive elements show population frequency heterogeneity consistent with these elements playing a role in adaptation to temperate climates. We conclude that TEs have contributed considerably to recent adaptive evolution (one TE-induced adaptation every 200–1,250 y). The majority of these adaptive insertions are likely to be involved in regulatory changes. Our results also suggest that TE-induced adaptations arise more often from standing variants than from new mutations. Such a high rate of TE-induced adaptation is inconsistent with the number of fixed TEs in the D. melanogaster genome, and we discuss possible explanations for this discrepancy.},

ABSTRACT = {Growing evidence shows a close association of transposable elements (TE) with non-coding RNAs (ncRNA), and a significant number of small ncRNAs originate from TEs. Further, ncRNAs linked with TE sequences participate in a wide-range of regulatory functions. Alu elements in particular are critical players in gene regulation and molecular pathways. Alu sequences embedded in both long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) and mRNAs form the basis of targeted mRNA decay via short imperfect base-pairing. Imperfect pairing is prominent in most ncRNA/target RNA interactions and found throughout all biological kingdoms. The piRNA-Piwi complex is multifunctional, but plays a major role in protection against invasion by transposons. This is an RNA-based genetic immune system similar to the one found in prokaryotes, the CRISPR system. Thousands of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are associated with endogenous retrovirus LTR transposable elements in human cells. These TEs can provide regulatory signals for lincRNA genes. A surprisingly large number of long circular ncRNAs have been discovered in human fibroblasts. These serve as “sponges” for miRNAs. Alu sequences, encoded in introns that flank exons are proposed to participate in RNA circularization via Alu/Alu base-pairing. Diseases are increasingly found to have a TE/ncRNA etiology. A single point mutation in a SINE/Alu sequence in a human long non-coding RNA leads to brainstem atrophy and death. On the other hand, genomic clusters of repeat sequences as well as lncRNAs function in epigenetic regulation. Some clusters are unstable, which can lead to formation of diseases such as facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. The future may hold more surprises regarding diseases associated with ncRNAs andTEs.},

abstract = {“Complex multicellularity,” conventionally defined as large organisms with many specialized cell types, has evolved five times independently in eukaryotes, but never within prokaryotes. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, most of which posit that eukaryotes evolved key traits (e.g., dynamic cytoskeletons, alternative mechanisms of gene regulation, or subcellular compartments) which were a necessary prerequisite for the evolution of complex multicellularity. Here, we propose an alternative, nonadaptive hypothesis for this broad macroevolutionary pattern. By binning cells into groups with finite genetic bottlenecks between generations, the evolution of multicellularity greatly reduces the effective population size (Ne) of cellular populations, increasing the role of genetic drift in evolutionary change. While both prokaryotes and eukaryotes experience this phenomenon, they have opposite responses to drift: eukaryotes tend to undergo genomic expansion, providing additional raw genetic material for subsequent multicellular innovation, while prokaryotes generally face genomic erosion. Taken together, we hypothesize that these idiosyncratic lineage-specific evolutionary dynamics play a fundamental role in the long-term divergent evolution of complex multicellularity across the tree of life.}}

Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

This phenomenon has led to the concept of a “fast‐slow continuum,” which has been influential in both empirical and theoretical studies of life‐history evolution. We present a comparative analysis of mammalian life histories showing that, for mammals at least, there is not a single fast‐slow continuum. Rather, both across and within mammalian clades, the speed of life varies along at least two largely independent axes when body size effects are removed. One axis reflects how species balance offspring size against offspring number, while the other describes the timing of reproductive bouts. }

An influential concept in life-history theory is the fast-slow continuum, exemplified by mammals. Determining the utility of such concepts across taxonomic groups requires comparison of the groups’ life histories in multidimensional space. Insects display enormous species richness and phenotypic diversity, but testing hypotheses like the fast-slow continuum has been inhibited by incomplete trait data. We use phylogenetic imputation to generate complete data sets of seven life-history traits in orthopterans (grasshoppers and crickets) and examine the robustness of these imputations for our findings. Three phylogenetic principal components explain 83\%–96\% of variation in these data. We find consistent evidence of an axis mostly following expectations of a fast-slow continuum, except that “slow” species produce larger, not smaller, clutches of eggs. We show that the principal axes of variation in orthopterans and reptiles are mutually explanatory, as are those of mammals and birds. Essentially, trait covariation in Orthoptera, with “slow” species producing larger clutches, is more reptilelike than mammal-like or birdlike. We conclude that the fast-slow continuum is less pronounced in Orthoptera than it is in birds and mammals, reducing the universal relevance of this pattern and the theories that predict it. }

               rates and lead to potentially false conclusions.Using
               simulations, we compared estimation accuracy, statistical power
               and type I error rates of linear mixed models (LMM) and
               phylogenetic linear mixed models (PLMM) designed to test for
               trait--environment interactions in the distribution of species

               phylogenetic signal in traits and phylogenetic signal in the
               residual variation in species distributions generated by an
               unmeasured (latent) trait with phylogenetic signal.When there
               was phylogenetic signal in the residual variation in species
               among sites, PLMM provided better estimates (closer to the true
               value) and greater statistical power for testing whether the
               trait--environment interaction regression coefficient differed
               from zero. LMM had unacceptably high type I error rates when

I find that when used improperly the phylogenetic regression can have poor statistical performance, even under some circumstances in which the type I error rate of the method is not inflated over its nominal level. 4. I also find, however, that when tests of phylogenetic signal in phylogenetic regression are applied properly, and in particular when phylogenetic signal in the residual error is simultaneously estimated with the regression parameters, the phylogenetic regression outperforms equivalent non-phylogenetic procedures.},

abstract = {Summary Ecologists and evolutionary biologists rely on an increasingly sophisticated set of statistical tools to describe complex natural systems. One such tool that has gained significant traction in the biological sciences is structural equation models (SEM), a form of path analysis that resolves complex multivariate relationships among a suite of interrelated variables. Evaluation of SEMs has historically relied on covariances among variables, rather than the values of the data points themselves. While this approach permits a wide variety of model forms, it limits the incorporation of detailed specifications. Recent developments have allowed for the simultaneous implementation of non-normal distributions, random effects and different correlation structures using local estimation, but this process is not yet automated and consequently, evaluation can be prohibitive with complex models. Here, I present a fully documented, open-source package piecewiseSEM, a practical implementation of confirmatory path analysis for the r programming language. The package extends this method to all current (generalized) linear, (phylogenetic) least-square, and mixed effects models, relying on familiar r syntax. I also provide two worked examples: one involving random effects and temporal autocorrelation, and a second involving phylogenetically independent contrasts. My goal is to provide a user-friendly and tractable implementation of SEM that also reflects the ecological and methodological processes generating data.},

abstract = {Despite great progress in uncovering the genomic underpinnings of advanced forms of social organization like eusociality, much less is known about how eusociality feeds back to drive genome evolution. Using snapping shrimps that exhibit multiple origins of eusociality and extreme interspecific variation in genome size, we show that eusocial species have larger genomes with more repetitive elements. Although our results support the idea that eusociality influences the accumulation of repetitive elements and an increase in genome size through changes in demography, there is also some evidence that repetitive elements could have also helped fuel the transition to eusociality in some lineages. Our work highlights a fluid relationship between genome and social evolution, demonstrating how eusociality can influence genome evolution and architecture. Despite progress uncovering the genomic underpinnings of sociality, much less is known about how social living affects the genome. In different insect lineages, for example, eusocial species show both positive and negative associations between genome size and structure, highlighting the dynamic nature of the genome. Here, we explore the relationship between sociality and genome architecture in Synalpheus snapping shrimps that exhibit multiple origins of eusociality and extreme interspecific variation in genome size. Our goal is to determine whether eusociality leads to an accumulation of repetitive elements and an increase in genome size, presumably due to reduced effective population sizes resulting from a reproductive division of labor, or whether an initial accumulation of repetitive elements leads to larger genomes and independently promotes the evolution of eusociality through adaptive evolution. Using phylogenetically informed analyses, we find that eusocial species have larger genomes with more transposable elements (TEs) and microsatellite repeats than noneusocial species. Interestingly, different TE subclasses contribute to the accumulation in different species. Phylogenetic path analysis testing alternative causal relationships between sociality and genome architecture is most consistent with the hypothesis that TEs modulate the relationship between sociality and genome architecture. Although eusociality appears to influence TE accumulation, ancestral state reconstruction suggests moderate TE abundances in ancestral species could have fueled the initial transitions to eusociality. Ultimately, we highlight a complex and dynamic relationship between genome and social evolution, demonstrating that sociality can influence the evolution of the genome, likely through changes in demography related to patterns of reproductive skew.}}

               the 2-Gb genome of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica,

  abstract  = "Meiotic recombination is almost universal among sexually
               reproducing organisms. Because the process leads to the
               destruction of successful parental allele combinations and the
               creation of novel, untested genotypes for offspring, the
               evolutionary forces responsible for the origin and maintenance
               of this counter-intuitive process are still enigmatic. Here, we
               have used newly available genetic data to compare genome-wide
               recombination rates in a report on recombination rates among
               different taxa. In particular, we find that among the higher
               eukaryotes exceptionally high rates are found in social
               Hymenoptera. The high rates are compatible with current
               hypotheses suggesting that sociality in insects strongly selects
               for increased genotypic diversity in worker offspring to either
               meet the demands of a sophisticated caste system or to mitigate

              detected in two groups of eusocial insects; honeybees and ants.
              In this study we estimate recombination rate in a eusocial wasp
              Vespula vulgaris that represents a third phylogenetic lineage
              within eusocial hymenopterans. RESULTS: A genetic linkage map of
              V. vulgaris based on 210 markers shows that the total map length
              is 2129 cM and the recombination rate is 9.7 cM/Mb (or 103
              kb/cM). The present estimate in V. vulgaris is somewhat smaller
              than in the honeybee Apis mellifera and intermediate between the
              estimates from two ant species (Acromyrmex echinatior,
              Pogonomyrmex rugosus). Altogether, the estimates from these
              eusocial species are higher than in any other insect reported so
              far. CONCLUSIONS: [corrected] The four species (V. vulgaris, A.
              mellifera, A. echinatior, P. rugosus) are characterized by
              advanced eusociality with large colonies, clear queen-worker
              dimorphism and well developed task specialization. They also have
              colonies with a single, normally multiply inseminated
              (polyandrous) queen. Benefits of genotypic diversity within
              colonies (e.g. through improved task specialization or pathogen
              and parasite resistance) may have selected for both polyandry and
              high recombination rate in such advanced eusocial insects.",

abstract = {Social insects (ants, bees, wasps and termites) as a group are species rich and ecologically dominant. Many are outstanding “ecological engineers”, or providers of “ecosystem services”, or potential bioindicator species. Few social insects are currently formally classified as Threatened, but this is almost certainly due to a lack of information on population sizes and trends in scarce species. The main influence that sociality has on threats faced by social insects is in reducing effective population sizes, increasing population genetic subdivision and possibly reducing levels of genetic variation relative to solitary species. The main influence that sociality has on threats from social insects is via its role in the ecological success of invasive species, which frequently pose a major hazard to native biotas. In some cases, social features underpinning ecological success in the original range almost certainly contribute to the success of invasive social insects. However, recent studies show or strongly suggest that, in some of the most notoriously invasive populations of ants, bees and wasps, novel social traits have arisen that greatly enhance the rate of spread and ecological competitiveness of these populations. Sociality can therefore represent either a liability or an asset in its contribution to the persistence of social insect populations.},

abstract = {Abstract Genome size varies considerably among organisms, largely as the result of differences in the content of non-coding and/or repetitive DNA, such as introns, pseudogenes, or transposable elements, as well as whole-genome duplications. Genome size is known to correlate with metabolic rates. Because polyphagy also affects the metabolism, a correlation between diet specialization and genome size can be expected. To test this hypothesis, a study was undertaken with five closely related species of stem borers which are easy to rear under artificial conditions, namely Busseola fusca (Fuller), Busseola segeta (Bowden), Busseola nairobica Le Ru, Sesamia calamistis Hampson, and Sesamia nonagrioides Lefebvre (all Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). However, as the number of species was too low for correlating diet with genome size in Lepidoptera in general, literature data from 16 Lepidoptera species were used in addition. The results pointed to a relationship between genome size and the insect's host plant range in Lepidoptera, but below the family level only, with larger genomes in polyphagous compared to specialist species. In addition, the genome size appeared to be influenced not only by host plant range but also by environmental/climatic conditions. Studies to test this hypothesis should be done strictly below the family level.},

The main causes of large genome size are proliferation of noncoding elements and/or duplication events. The relative role and interplay between these proximate causes and the evolutionary patterns shaped by phylogeny, life history traits or environment are largely unknown for the arthropods. Genome size shows a tremendous variability in this group, and it has a major impact on a range of fitness-related parameters such as growth, metabolism, life history traits, and for many species also body size. In this study, we compared genome size in two major arthropod groups, insects and crustaceans, and related this to phylogenetic patterns and parameters affecting ambient temperature (latitude, depth, or altitude), insect developmental mode, as well as crustacean body size and habitat, for species where data were available. For the insects, the genome size is clearly phylogeny-dependent, reflecting primarily their life history and mode of development, while for crustaceans there was a weaker association between genome size and phylogeny, suggesting life cycle strategies and habitat as more important determinants. Maximum observed latitude and depth, and their combined effect, showed positive, and possibly phylogenetic independent, correlations with genome size for crustaceans. This study illustrate the striking difference in genome sizes both between and within these two major groups of arthropods, and that while living in the cold with low developmental rates may promote large genomes in marine crustaceans, there is a multitude of proximate and ultimate drivers of genome size.},

The changes include gradual increases in gene number, resulting from the retention of duplicate genes, and more abrupt increases in the abundance of spliceosomal introns and mobile genetic elements. We argue that many of these modifications emerged passively in response to the long-term population-size reductions that accompanied increases in organism size. According to this model, much of the restructuring of eukaryotic genomes was initiated by nonadaptive processes, and this in turn provided novel substrates for the secondary evolution of phenotypic complexity by natural selection. The enormous long-term effective population sizes of prokaryotes may impose a substantial barrier to the evolution of complex genomes and morphologies.}}

               to new adaptive paths. Here we use high-dimensional phenotyping
               of laboratory-evolved budding yeast lineages to demonstrate that
               new cellular morphologies emerge exceptionally rapidly as a
               by-product of gene loss and subsequent compensatory evolution.
               Unexpectedly, the capacities for invasive growth, multicellular
               aggregation and biofilm formation also spontaneously evolve in
               response to gene loss. These multicellular phenotypes can be
               achieved by diverse mutational routes and without reactivating
               the canonical regulatory pathways. These ecologically and
               clinically relevant traits originate as pleiotropic side effects
               of compensatory evolution and have no obvious utility in the
               laboratory environment. The extent of morphological diversity in
               the evolved lineages is comparable to that of natural yeast
               isolates with diverse genetic backgrounds and lifestyles.
               Finally, we show that both the initial gene loss and subsequent
               compensatory mutations contribute to new morphologies, with
               their synergistic effects underlying specific morphological
               changes. We conclude that compensatory evolution is a previously

               found that Scaptomyza flava, a leaf-mining specialist on plants
               in the family (Brassicaceae), was not attracted to yeast
               volatiles in a four-field olfactometer assay, whereas D.

               Yeast-associated volatiles, especially short-chain aliphatic

               Although we often think of evolution as a process of
               accumulation, it is also a process of loss. Here, we document an
               example of regressive evolution of an effector activity in the
               Irish potato famine pathogen (Phytophthora infestans) lineage,
               providing evidence that a key sequence motif in the effector
               PexRD54 has degenerated following a host jump. We began by
               looking at PexRD54 and PexRD54-like sequences from across
               Phytophthora species. We found that PexRD54 emerged in the
               common ancestor of Phytophthora clade 1b and 1c species, and
               further sequence analysis showed that a key functional motif,
               the C-terminal ATG8-interacting motif (AIM), was also acquired
               at this point in the lineage. A closer analysis showed that the
               P. mirabilis PexRD54 (PmPexRD54) AIM is atypical, the
               otherwise-conserved central residue mutated from a glutamate to
               a lysine. We aimed to determine whether this PmPexRD54 AIM
               polymorphism represented an adaptation to the Mirabilis jalapa
               host environment. We began by characterizing the M. jalapa ATG8
               family, finding that they have a unique evolutionary history
               compared to previously characterized ATG8s. Then, using
               co-immunoprecipitation and isothermal titration calorimetry
               assays, we showed that both full-length PmPexRD54 and the
               PmPexRD54 AIM peptide bind weakly to the M. jalapa ATG8s.
               Through a combination of binding assays and structural
               modelling, we showed that the identity of the residue at the
               position of the PmPexRD54 AIM polymorphism can underpin
               high-affinity binding to plant ATG8s. Finally, we conclude that
               the functionality of the PexRD54 AIM was lost in the P.

In eukaryote microorganisms, as well as in animals and plants, DNA content is strongly correlated with cell volume and nuclear volume, and with cell cycle length and minimum generation time. These correlations are simply explained by postulating that DNA has 2 major functions unrelated to its proteincoding capacity: (1) the control of cell volume by the number of replicon origins, and (2) the determination of nuclear volume by the overall bulk of the DNA; cell growth rates are determined by the cell volume and by the area of the nuclear envelope available for nucleocytoplasmic transport of RNA, which in turn depends on the nuclear volume and therefore on the DNA content. During evolution nuclear volume, and therefore DNA content, has to be adjusted to the cell volume to allow reasonable growth rates.The great diversity of cell volumes and growth rates, and therefore of DNA contents, among eukaryotes results from a varying balance in different species between r-selection, which favours small cells and rapid growth rates and therefore low DNA C-values, and K-selection which favours large cells and slow growth rates and therefore high DNA C-values. In multicellular organisms cell size needs to vary in different tissues: size differences between somatic cells result from polyteny, endopolyploidy, or the synthesis of nucleoskeletal RNA. Conflict between the need for large ova and small somatic cells explains why lampbrush chromosomes, nurse cells, chromatin diminution and chromosome elimination evolved. Similar evolutionary considerations clarify the nature of polygenes, the significance of the distribution of haploidy, diploidy and dikaryosis in life cycles and of double fertilization in angiosperms, and of hetero-ploidy despite DNA constancy in cultured cells, and other puzzles in eukaryote chromosome biology.Eukaryote DNA can be divided into genic DNA (G-DNA), which codes for proteins (or serves as recognition sites for proteins involved in transcription, replication and recombination), and nucleoskeletal DNA (S-DNA) which exists only because of its nucleoskeletal role in determining the nuclear volume (which it shares with G-DNA, and performs not only directly, but also indirectly by coding for nucleoskeletal RNA).

               establishment by cell expansion and multiplication may affect
               metabolic rate and its scaling with body mass. Cell size and

               metabolic scaling relationships. Mechanistic causes of negative
               correlations between cell size and metabolic rate may involve
               reduced resource supply and/or demand in larger cells, related
               to decreased surface area per volume, larger intracellular

Present empirical data suggest that these scaling relationships take the form of power laws with exponents that are simple multiples of one quarter. A compelling explanation of this observation was put forward a decade ago by West, Brown, and Enquist (WBE). Their framework elucidates the link between metabolic rate and body mass by focusing on the dynamics and structure of resource distribution networks—the cardiovascular system in the case of mammals. Within this framework the WBE model is based on eight assumptions from which it derives the well-known observed scaling exponent of 3/4. In this paper we clarify that this result only holds in the limit of infinite network size (body mass) and that the actual exponent predicted by the model depends on the sizes of the organisms being studied. Failure to clarify and to explore the nature of this approximation has led to debates about the WBE model that were at cross purposes. We compute analytical expressions for the finite-size corrections to the 3/4 exponent, resulting in a spectrum of scaling exponents as a function of absolute network size. When accounting for these corrections over a size range spanning the eight orders of magnitude observed in mammals, the WBE model predicts a scaling exponent of 0.81, seemingly at odds with data. We then proceed to study the sensitivity of the scaling exponent with respect to variations in several assumptions that underlie the WBE model, always in the context of finite-size corrections. Here too, the trends we derive from the model seem at odds with trends detectable in empirical data. Our work illustrates the utility of the WBE framework in reasoning about allometric scaling, while at the same time suggesting that the current canonical model may need amendments to bring its predictions fully in line with available datasets.},

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Early evolution of animals led to profound changes
               in body plan organization, symmetry and the rise of tissue
               complexity including formation of muscular and nervous systems.
               This process was associated with massive restructuring of animal
               genomes as well as deletion, acquisition and rapid
               differentiation of genes from a common metazoan ancestor. Here,
               we present a simple but efficient workflow for elucidation of
               gene gain and gene loss within major branches of the animal
               kingdom. METHODS: We have designed a pipeline of sequence
               comparison, clustering and functional annotation using 12 major
               phyla as illustrative examples. Specifically, for the input we
               used sets of ab initio predicted gene models from the genomes of
               six bilaterians, three basal metazoans (Cnidaria, Placozoa,
               Porifera), two unicellular eukaryotes (Monosiga and Capsospora)
               and the green plant Arabidopsis as an out-group. Due to the
               large amounts of data the software required a high-performance
               Linux cluster. The final results can be imported into standard
               spreadsheet analysis software and queried for the numbers and
               specific sets of genes absent in specific genomes, uniquely
               present or shared among different taxons. RESULTS AND
               CONCLUSIONS: The developed software is open source and available
               free of charge on Open Source principles. It allows the user to
               address a number of specific questions regarding gene gain and
               gene loss in particular genomes, and user-defined groups of
               genomes can be formulated in a type of logical expression. For
               example, our analysis of 12 sequenced genomes indicated that
               these genomes possess at least 90,000 unique genes and gene
               families, suggesting enormous diversity of the genome repertoire

               proteins are encoded in the nucleus. Endosymbiotic theory posits
               that bacterial genes in eukaryotic genomes entered the

               influx of prokaryotic genes into the eukaryotic lineage, with
               acquisition corresponding to endosymbiotic events. Eukaryotic

Recent transcriptomic studies provide detailed inventories of the genes involved in producing distinct phenotypes in social species.

  abstract  = "Within-species variation in animal body size predicts major
               differences in life history, for example, in reproductive
               development, fecundity, and even longevity. Purely from an
               energetic perspective, large size could entail larger energy
               reserves, fuelling different life functions, such as
               reproduction and survival (the ``energy reserve'' hypothesis).
               Conversely, larger body size could demand more energy for
               maintenance, and larger individuals might do worse in
               reproduction and survival under resource shortage (the ``energy
               demand'' hypothesis). Disentangling these alternative hypotheses
               is difficult because large size often correlates with better
               resource availability during growth, which could mask direct
               effects of body size on fitness traits. Here, we used
               experimental body size manipulation in the freshwater cnidarian
               Hydra oligactis, coupled with manipulation of resource (food)
               availability to separate direct effects of body size from
               resource availability on fitness traits (sexual development
               time, fecundity, and survival). We found significant interaction
               between body size and food availability in sexual development
               time in both males and females, such that large individuals
               responded less strongly to variation in resource availability.
               These results are consistent with an energy reserve effect of
               large size in Hydra. Surprisingly, the response was different in
               males and females: small and starved females delayed their
               reproduction, while small and starved males developed
               reproductive organs faster. In case of fecundity and survival,
               both size and food availability had significant effects, but we
               detected no interaction between them. Our observations suggest
               that in Hydra, small individuals are sensitive to fluctuations
               in resource availability, but these small individuals are able
               to adjust their reproductive development to maintain fitness.",

abstract = {Summary 1. Body size is positively correlated with fecundity in various animals, but the factors that counterbalance the resulting selection pressure towards large size are difficult to establish. Positively size-dependent predation risk has been proposed as a selective factor potentially capable of balancing the fecundity advantage of large size. 2. To construct optimality models of insect body size, realistic estimates of size-dependent predation rates are necessary. Moreover, prey traits such as colouration should be considered, as they may substantially alter the relationship between body size and mortality risk. 3. To quantify mortality patterns, we conducted field experiments in which we exposed cryptic and conspicuous artificial larvae of different sizes to bird predators, and recorded the incidence of bird attacks. 4. The average daily mortality rate was estimated to vary between 4\% and 10\%. In both cryptic and conspicuous larvae, predation risk increased with prey size, but the increase tended to be steeper in the conspicuous group. No main effect of colour type was found. All the quantitative relationships were reasonably consistent across replicates. 5. Our results suggest that the size dependence of mortality risk in insect prey is primarily determined by the probability of being detected by a predator rather than by a size-dependent warning effect associated with conspicuous colouration. Our results therefore imply that warningly coloured insects do not necessarily benefit more than the cryptic species from large body size, as has been previously suggested.},

  abstract  = "The growth of complexity in evolution is a most intriguing
               phenomenon. Using gene phylostratigraphy, we showed this growth
               (as reflected in regulatory mechanisms) in the human genome,
               tracing the path from prokaryotes to hominids. Generally, the
               different regulatory gene families expanded at different times,
               yet only up to the Euteleostomi (bony vertebrates). The only
               exception was the expansion of transcription factors (TF) in
               placentals; however, we argue that this was not related to
               increase in general complexity. Surprisingly, although TF
               originated in the Prokaryota while chromatin appeared only in
               the Eukaryota, the expansion of epigenetic factors predated the
               expansion of TF. Signaling receptors, tumor suppressors,
               oncogenes, and aging- and disease-associated genes (indicating
               vulnerabilities in terms of complex organization and strongly
               enrichment in regulatory genes) also expanded only up to the
               Euteleostomi. The complexity-related gene properties (protein
               size, number of alternative splicing mRNA, length of
               untranslated mRNA, number of biological processes per gene,
               number of disordered regions in a protein, and density of TF-TF
               interactions) rose in multicellular organisms and declined after
               the Euteleostomi, and possibly earlier. At the same time, the
               speed of protein sequence evolution sharply increased in the
               genes that originated after the Euteleostomi. Thus, several
               lines of evidence indicate that molecular mechanisms of
               complexity growth were changing with time, and in the phyletic
               lineage leading to humans, the most salient shift occurred after
               the basic vertebrate body plan was fixed with bony skeleton. The

               attractive subjects for studying the evolution of developmental
               mechanisms. Comparative analyses suggest that arthropod
               diversity has arisen largely as a result of changes in
               expression patterns of genes that control development. Direct
               analysis of how a particular gene functions in a given species
               during development is hindered by the lack of broadly applicable
               techniques for manipulating gene expression. RESULTS: We report
               that the Arbovirus Sindbis can be used to deliver high levels of
               gene expression in vivo in a number of non-host arthropod
               species without causing cytopathic effects in infected cells or
               impairing development. Using recombinant Sindbis virus, we
               investigated the function of the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax in
               the development of butterfly wings and beetle embryos. Ectopic
               Ultrabithorax expression in butterfly forewing imaginal discs
               was sufficient to cause the transformation of characteristic
               forewing properties in the adult, including scale morphology and
               pigmentation, to those of the hindwing. Expression of
               Ultrabithorax in beetle embryos outside of its endogenous
               expression domain affected normal development of the body wall
               cuticle and appendages. CONCLUSIONS: The homeotic genes have
               long been thought to play an important role in the
               diversification of arthropod appendages. Using recombinant
               Sindbis virus, we were able to investigate homeotic gene
               function in non-model arthropod species. We found that
               Ultrabithorax is sufficient to confer hindwing identity in
               butterflies and alter normal development of anterior structures
               in beetles. Recombinant Sindbis virus has broad potential as a
               tool for analyzing how the function of developmental genes has

Spanning roles from pollination to decomposition, these organisms also intersect with socio-economic, cultural, and public health sectors. This review delves into the diverse spheres of insect interactions within ecosystems, from their evolutionary histories to their roles as both predators and prey. The paper sheds light on the intricate predator-prey dynamics, emphasizing insects’ roles in pest control and as pivotal food sources for various taxa. The significance of insects in soil ecosystems is elaborated upon, highlighting their contribution to soil health, nutrient cycling, and plant growth. With the looming threats of climate change, habitat destruction, and pollution, insects face unprecedented challenges, which in turn can have cascading effects on ecosystems. In the realm of public health, the review underscores the role of insects as disease vectors, necessitating a balanced approach to ecosystem health and disease management. As vectors, they also catalyze the spread of diseases, creating an intricate balance between maintaining biodiversity and safeguarding human health. The review also touches upon the cultural and economic contributions of insects, from traditional medicine to their utilization in contemporary diets, demonstrating their deep-rooted ties with human societies. With burgeoning technological advancements, the research landscape in entomology is undergoing a seismic shift. Embracing tools such as molecular studies, drones, and AI, the field is poised for groundbreaking insights. As the review suggests, the path forward demands an interdisciplinary approach, amalgamating knowledge from varied scientific domains to grasp the complexities of insect behaviors and interactions fully.

abstract = {Summary Approaches for efficient statistical estimation of large phylogenies are now available (Bioinformatics, 2006, 22, 2688), and yet we lack adequate tools for synthesizing information from previous analyses into large timetrees. Here, we present a cross-platform r tool that integrates with tree of life efforts by mapping divergence times from an existing timetree (a ‘reference’) to another uncalibrated phylogeny (a ‘target’) that samples from the same lineage. Leveraging existing methods for rate-smoothing phylograms, this tool enables the rapid generation of very large timetrees where direct estimation of the timing of lineage diversification is either impracticable or impossible. The primary output of the tool is to return divergence times for nodes resolved as concordant between the reference and target. Given the computed set of secondary calibrations, post hoc tree transformation can be accomplished using existing resources that assume either a strict or relaxed evolutionary clock. Our software is provided open source in the geiger package (http://cran.r-project.org/package=geiger) and is thoroughly demonstrated in the Supporting Information.},

  author    = "Moreno, E and Morata, G",
  abstract  = "The homeobox gene caudal (cad) has a maternal embryonic function
               that establishes the antero-posterior body axis of Drosophila.
               It also has a conserved late embryonic and imaginal function
               related to the development of the posterior body region. Here we
               report the developmental role of cad in adult Drosophila. It is
               required for the normal development of the analia structures,
               which derive from the most posterior body segment. In the
               absence of cad function, the analia develop like the immediately
               anterior segment (male genitalia), following the transformation
               rule of the canonical Hox genes. We also show that cad can
               induce ectopic analia development if expressed in the head or
               wing. We propose that cad is the Hox gene that determines the
               development of the fly's most posterior segment. cad acts in
               combination with the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway to specify the
               different components of the analia: the activities of cad and of
               the Hh pathway induce Distal-less expression that, together with
               cad, promote external analia development. In the absence of the
               Hh pathway, cad induces internal analia development, probably by
               activating the brachyenteron and even-skipped genes.",

abstract = {The rough mutation in Drosophila disrupts an early stage of ommatidial assembly in the developing eye imaginal disc. Analysis of somatic mosaics suggests that rough gene function is required only in photoreceptors R2 and R5. However, these cells apparently differentiate normally in mutant eye discs and it is the cells that are subsequently added to the ommatidium that behave aberrantly. The rough gene was isolated by P-element transposon tagging, and the mutant can be rescued by transformation with an 8.6 kb genomic fragment. The rough transcription unit is 4.3 kb and consists of three exons that are joined in a 1.3 kb mRNA. The predicted rough protein is 350 amino acids long and contains a homeobox. Taken together, our results suggest that the role of the rough gene product may be to regulate the sending of signals by photoreceptors R2 and R5 to their neighbors in the developing ommatidia.}
